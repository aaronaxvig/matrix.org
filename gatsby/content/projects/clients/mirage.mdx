Mirage is a new fancy Matrix client written in Qt/QML + Python, currently in alpha and available on Linux. Some of its main features are:

* A fluid interface that adapts to any size keyboard shortcuts for (almost) everything, including filtering/switching rooms, scrolling, sending files, selecting and copying messages...
* A dynamic, programable theming system
* Multiple accounts in one client
* Support for end-to-end encryption
